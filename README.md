# GeckoLoader
**GeckoLoader is a command line tool, providing an easy way to have near unlimited code space, allowing thousands of lines of gecko code for every Wii/GCN game.**

**Steps to compile GeckoLoader**

   1. Extract main.dol/Start.dol (varies by extraction method) from the desired game into the same directory as "GeckoLoader.exe"
   2. Move your GCT into the same directory as "GeckoLoader.exe"
   3. In command prompt (In the same directory as GeckoLoader.exe), input: .\GeckoLoader.exe -h, for help on syntax and options, then run accordingly

Your new patched main.dol/Start.dol will be in the folder ./BUILD/
