# GeckoLoader
**An easy way to have near unlimited code space, allowing thousands of lines of gecko code for every Wii/GCN game.**

**Steps to compile GeckoLoader**

   1. Extract main.dol/Start.dol (varies by extraction method) from the desired game into the same directory as "GeckoLoader.exe"
   2. Move your GCT into the same directory as "GeckoLoader.exe"
   3. In command prompt, input: GeckoLoader.exe -h, for help on syntax and options, then run accordingly

Your new patched main.dol/Start.dol will be in the folder ./BUILD/
